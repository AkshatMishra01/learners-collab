in this file we are going to discuss some of the models to implement and code on small projects.

but before that we will learn some prerequisites or rather some pre stages of working on the small projects:
 1) V-shaped model:
 . requirements
 .system design
 .architecture design
 .module design
 .implementation/coding
 .unit testing
 .integration testing
 .system testing
 .acceptance testing
